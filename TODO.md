# TODOs

Entries are slugs joined to `TODO(slug)` comments in the tree. See `CLAUDE.md`
for the convention — including that this file ships publicly.

## `example-placeholder` (DO NOT TRIAGE — this is a fake entry)

This is a placeholder entry. Leave it here so the file is never empty. It is not
a real TODO. You would reference it in code with a `TODO(example-placeholder)`
comment. That is the whole design: an entry here with a slug, joined to code
comments by that slug. Add real TODOs below this one, in this format.

## `bus-watchdog-policy`

Decide whether the servos' Bus Watchdog register is armed, and with what
timeout. It stays at its factory-disabled value of 0 for now.

Deferral context: the watchdog stops a servo holding its goal when the host goes
quiet, which on this linkage means the head falls, and a latched watchdog then
answers writes with the same Data Range error an out-of-range goal produces —
two failures that would be indistinguishable at the bus layer. Arming it is only
worth considering once the command loop's real timing has been measured on
hardware, so the timeout can be set from data rather than guessed. Marked at the
register definition in `crates/dxl-proto/src/regs.rs`.

## `bus-echo-policy`

Decide whether the serial path this project drives reflects the host's own
transmission back into the receive stream, and make the transaction loop's
handling of that case explicit either way.

Deferral context: on a half-duplex bus some transceivers deliver the outgoing
frame back to the receiver before the servo's reply. Such a frame is well formed
and passes its checksum, so the decoder can only report it as a frame that is
not a status packet — and the transaction layer treats every such verdict as a
wire fault it must never retry. If this path reflects, that combination fails
every exchange from the first ping onward; if it does not, the loop should say
so rather than leave a future reader to assume it. Which of the two holds is an
observation about the hardware and cannot be settled off the machine, so the
decision waits for the first read-only run against the servos. Marked at the
crate root in `crates/reachy-bus/src/lib.rs`.

## `geometry-fit`

Measure this unit's crank length, rod length, base radius and platform radius on
the bench, and substitute the fitted values for the vendor's nominal ones in
`HeadGeometry`.

Deferral context: the defaults are the vendor's published nominal model, and a
second parameter set differing from it by a few millimetres has been written down
for this linkage — evidence that more than one set exists, not that more than one
build does. Millimetres are large against the clearance the crank stops leave at
the top of vertical travel, which is about one, so the nominal numbers should not
be treated as the only ones that have ever described the mechanism. The struct is
already a runtime configuration seam for exactly this substitution; what is
missing is the measurement, which needs the machine. Marked at `HeadGeometry` in
`crates/reachy-kin/src/geometry.rs`.
